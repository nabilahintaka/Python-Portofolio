# Cases
You are a Python developer at a retail company. You are asked to create a simple shopping cart program that allows users to add, remove, and view items in their shopping carts. Each item has information about the item name and price. Users can also see the total price of their purchases.

**Requirements**

1. Create a list or dictionary to store item data in the shopping cart.

2. Create a Shopping Cart program that contains features to add items, delete items, calculate total purchases, and run the application user interface. Each feature must be created in a function.

3. The program must be a menu-based interface where the user will interact with their shopping cart.

  The menu options must include:
  1. Add Item
  2. Delete Item
  3. Show Item in Cart
  4. View Total Shopping
  5. Exit

If there is an error in inputting the menu or inputting the requested value, an error message will appear.

Data entered through menu number 1 is saved to the list or dictionary created and to delete items from the shopping cart, adjust the method of deleting items from the list or dictionary.

4. Use `While Loop` and `Conditional If` so that the user can continue to interact with the program until the user selects the exit menu.

5. Running the program `<student-name>_app.py` in `Anaconda Prompt` or `Terminal MacOS/Linux` and screenshot the running program and its results.

**Example of interface program:**
